## Title

Search for Spatio Temporal Resources

## Synopsis

In major cities it has been observed that 30% of the traffic comprises of individuals cruising for a parking spot. This shows that the search for traffic is an enormous source of congestion. Thereare a number of projects whose sole aim is reduce this problem. One instance taken into consideration is the SFPark project. The SFPark is a project initiated by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, in which wireless sensors were embedded under the pavement in order to provide real time data. This application provides a list of available parking spots and the user would manually have to choose one. This would make it difficult for the user to make a decision while driving. In order to solve this issue we aim to create an algorithm that provides directions to the users at each intersection, from the start location to the destination.
